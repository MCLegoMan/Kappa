# Kappa
A custom origin made for JudgeAlexander  

**Origin Powers (to be rewritten once coded)**  
- [x] water breathing, cant breathe on land, the usual  
- [x] only helmet I can wear is turtle shell, and if not too complicated to code, I have slowness 3 or 4 when on land without one equipped (kappas have a water dish on their head that when emptied they turn to stone, i think this would be a cool way to reference this)  
- [x] kappas can sumo wrestle, minecraft sumo pvp has always been punching with fists and knocking someone off a ledge, so maybe knockback 1 on my fist  
- [ ] cant use, wear, or handle iron (cant ride minecarts, wear iron armor, iron tools, hold iron ingots or iron blocks)  
- [ ] iron golems are hostile to me by default  
- [ ] a bit short, maybe .75 or .8 the normal player height  
- [x] aqua affinity by defualt, but no depth strider (depth strider messes up tridents with riptide ):< )  
- [x] vegetarian, cant eat meat (this isnt true to the folklore however they love cucumbers so instead of having an affinty for a crop that doesnt exist, i think just eating vegetables to compensate will make a bit of sense  
- [ ] susceptible to the cold. anytime im in a cold biome, i get the powdered snow freezing effect
